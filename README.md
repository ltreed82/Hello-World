# Hello-World
My First Repository to be used for educational purposes.
This is my first venture into Github.  This is a small step into a future that I can make into a career.  I fear that I will quit before committing to learn programming.  I have a hard time committing to plans I make for myself.  I feel I can give this a better effort compared with leaning Italian or learning to play the guitar.  Those were skills I wanted to learn but had no purpose or real plan to use those skills.  They would have been skills just to impress but not make me money.  Learning to program on the other hand will open doors for new opportunities.  Programming comes with a higher pay scale and is in demand everywhere.  Programming will give me the ability to create projects and continue learning even when I am at home.  At my current job, I am a Wind Turbine Technician.  I had hoped this job would give me purpose and that I could retire in this career.  I have had this job for about seven years now.  I do not feel purpose and I feel as though I am forgetting how to do my job rather than getting better.  I just donâ€™t want to do this job anymore and there is the ever-looming possibility of getting hurt or dying on the job.  This threat was always part of the job, I just no longer feel it is a necessary risk for a way to make a living.  With better pay, more comfortable surroundings, and safer environment, programming was simply an easy choice to make.
